----------------------
use starting conditions
----------------------
- In definition section: 				%start cond1 cond2 cond3    (any order)
- Condition may be referenced at head of a rule: 	<condX> expr
- Enter a condition with BEGIN cond, resume lex state with BEGIN 0
----------------------
Handling ambiguous spec
----------------------
- Longest match wins
- Among rules with the same number of chars…specification order is used
